# make-your-own-chatbot-By-Ametist

First of all, I would like to point out that this program was developed by a novice programmer and it will probably not be of any use to you.
You can review the Example.py file in the Plugins section. There are no limits to what you can do. For example, since Music Bot v.1.0 was developed in a hurry, this version may not be of much use to you. Wait for version 1.1.

some 1.1 features:
-music bot
-Spam bot
-Calculator bot
-ChatGPT(I couldn't do it.but maybe you can code and add)
-Maybe I'll rebuild the app in C#
-discord explosion bot(maybe)
-google bot(maybe)
-and more

I don't know if the program works on Linux, but it probably will.
